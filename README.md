# Angular-CMS

This git repo is following the tutoral posted on  [HenslerSE](https://henslerse.co.uk/blog/)

## Getting Started

We are going to split the development into a different modules, they are as follows:-

* Initial Setup
* Creating the admin panel and basic layout
* Page Creator
* Post Creator
* Comments System
* User Setup
* Dashboard
* Frontend Template

We will be using Material UI and Semantic UI for the CSS framework.<br/>
We will only be importing the Semantic UI grid system as I find this better than the Material UI grid.
